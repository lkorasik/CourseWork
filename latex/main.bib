  abstract = {(1) The general form of density-dependent relationships is discussed and illustrated with examples. These are compared with the relationships predicted from two other models for density-dependence. (2) A new model is proposed which has the properties that (1) at high population densities, the relationship between mortality, or natality (expressed as k-values), and the log density is characterized by a constant slope (b) and (2) the degree of density-dependence decreases as population density falls. (3) The stability properties of this model are discussed. A population may exhibit exponential damping, oscillatory damping, or stable limit cycle behaviour, depending upon the parameter (b) and the effective rate of increase of the population (lambda).},
